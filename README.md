# ConversAI: Your Gateway to Dynamic AI Conversations

## 🌟 Overview
ConversAI is an interactive conversational AI interface built with Gradio, enabling users to engage with advanced AI models for generating coherent and meaningful responses. This project demonstrates how to seamlessly integrate APIs for handling conversational prompts and responses.

## 🛠 Features
- **Gradio-based UI:** A user-friendly interface for real-time AI interactions.
- **Customizable History:** Maintains a session-wide conversation history to enable contextual responses.
- **API Integration:** Interacts with a powerful backend API for prompt generation.

## 🚀 Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8+
- Pip

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/0Xuser100/ConversAI-Your-Gateway-to-Dynamic-AI-Conversations-Your-Code-Assistant.git
   cd ConversAI-Your-Gateway-to-Dynamic-AI-Conversations-Your-Code-Assistant
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage
1. Run the app:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
2. Open the Gradio link displayed in the terminal to interact with ConversAI.

### API Integration
The app is configured to communicate with a local API:
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:11434/api/generate`
- **Headers:** `Content-Type: application/json`

Update the `url` variable in `app.py` to point to your desired API endpoint if needed.

## 📂 File Structure
- `app.py` - Main application script to launch the Gradio interface.
- `requirements.txt` - List of required Python libraries.
